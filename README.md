## Project Overview

The Ant Repellinator (AR) is an ant-control car that will detect and deter ants in a given room. The AR will work by placing it in the corner of a room, after which it will traverse the edge of the room, determining where the ants. After a pre-determined data-collection period, the AR will loop back around the room, releasing a surface-treatment liquid to repel ants from entering the room through those entry points. The project will likely take 5-6 months of tri-weekly work, and is expected to be completed well into the spring due to field testing being unfeasable during winter. 

The AR will have four general parts: The car, the guidance system, the detection system, and the spray system. The car consists of the chassis and wheels. The guidance system will consist an ultrasonic sensor and a stepper motor. The ant-detection circuit will use an ESP-32 CAM. All three parts will be controlled by a central ESP-32 Arduino. 

The components are:
an ESP-32 (have)
an ultrasonic sensor (have)
an ESP-32 cam (do not have) 
a stepper motor (do not have)
two DC motors (do not have)
